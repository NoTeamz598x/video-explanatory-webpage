   <h1>The First Chapter</h1>
    <p>The difference between the h1 and h2 code is how it appears on a website, what this means is h1 is the biggest header and this continues all the way to h6 (which is the smallest header).</p>

    <h2>The Second Chapter</h2>
    <p>The (p) codes is where all the information is filled.</p>
    <p>It also causes webpages to be filled with information and details are being talked about. </p>

    <h3>The Third Chapter</h3>
    <p id="poe">CSS is what causes this website to change, whether it is the font itself, the color of this font.</p>

    <h4>The Fourth Chapter</h4>
    <p>What you saw in header three is something called "class and ids." What this means is that those specific sections of code is categorized into individual groups.</p>
    <p>Class is used to separate mutiple sections of code and make it easier to style it in CSS. While Ids are used to separate only 1 section of code to be edited separately on CSS.  </p>

    <h5>The Fifth Chapter</h5>
    <p>Next up I will show you what is the difference between <strong><em>"ordered lists and unordered lists"</em></p></strong>

<div class="cold">
    <ul>
        <li class="cold">Unordered List (UL) are listed as bullet points</li>
        <li class="cold">List Item (LI) are used to enter the information in the bullet points</li>
        <li class="cold">The bullet points represents items that are just listed and that have no specific order</li>
        <li class="cold">These are used to create lists such as grocery lists and listing any favorite movies, etc.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <ol>
        <li class="warm">Ordered List (OL) are listed as numbers</li>
        <li class="warm">(LI) codes are also used to fill information, the same way as (UL) items</li>
        <li class="warm">The numbers represent items that are in a specific order such as top 10 lists</li>
        <li class="warm">For example, this can be used to be a top 10 most favorite movie of the last decade</li>
    </ol>
